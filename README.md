Hi Vincent, 
Hi everyone here to read and evaluate my work
This repository aims to discover the landscape of google merchandise sample dataset.



# GA4 User Segmentation Project

This repository contains the analysis performed on the
`bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce` dataset,
with the goal of segmenting users into **New, Active, Dormant, and Lost** buckets.

## Repository Structure
- `sql/` → SQL queries for segmentation and daily evolution
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter/Colab notebooks with detailed explanations and code
- `docs/` → Business recommendations and automation plan
- `requirements.txt` → Python dependencies (if running notebooks locally)

## Deliverables
1. Code for user segmentation (SQL + Python notebooks)
2. Recommendations (docs/recommendations.md)
3. Automation plan (docs/automation.md)

## How to Run
- Open the queries in `sql/` directly in BigQuery Console
- Or run the notebooks in `notebooks/` (Colab/Jupyter) with a valid GCP project
