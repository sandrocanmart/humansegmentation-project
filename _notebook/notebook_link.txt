In the link above you find GCP notebook, which covers the key 
analysis (ad campaigns, event volumes, and their 
trends over time) and concludes with the segmentation. 
You can access it via the link in the file header; 
if for any reason the link doesnâ€™t work, the notebook 
file is also included in this folder.
